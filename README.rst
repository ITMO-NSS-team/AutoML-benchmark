AutoML-benchmark
================

This tool will help you to execute different AutoMl frameworks with
problem data you want. The repository already has some cases
(i.e. credit_scoring), the ability to work with PMLB datasets and open
to new experiments.

Currently, ``core`` directory implements the functionality of the FEDOT
Framework.
